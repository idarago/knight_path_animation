# knight_path_animation
This snippet allows you to click on any two tiles of a chessboard and shows a path of a knight from one to the other of shortest length.
The shortest paths are calculated with the standard Dijkstra algorithm on the Python script, saved and hardcoded into de JavaScript file with the animations. These animations are done using the d3.js library.
